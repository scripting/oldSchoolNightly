# oldSchoolNightly

A script that runs on the same machine as my CMS, that uploads JSON, OPML, RSS and HTML files from Scripting News to the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog">repository</a> on GitHub, every night.

### Pointers

A new <a href="http://this.how/scriptingNews/nightlyArchive.opml">FAQ</a> explains how this works, and provides a rationale for using GitHub as a second place to archive a blog.
